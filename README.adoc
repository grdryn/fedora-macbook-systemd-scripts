# fedora-macbook-systemd-scripts

# What

Systemd startup files to make Fedora sane on my MacBook Pro.

* Make the brightness keyboard shortcuts work
* Make Fn key behaviour normal (non-OSX behaviour)
* Fix tilde mapping on MBP keyboard
* Prevent reawakening immediately after suspend
** This last one may need to be adjusted for different hardware models or OS
   configurations.

# How

The files here in `etc/systemd/system` need to be put into `/etc/systemd/system`,
then started (for the current session) and enabled (to happen on startup).
For example:

    sudo systemctl start macbook-brightness.service
    sudo systemctl enable macbook-brightness.service
